Repo for FED Assignment 01

For my Assignment 1, I am choosing to create a website for the Japanese rock band My First Story.

Design Process
--------------
This website is for the band My First Story and is intended to allow existing and potential fans to learn about the band, alongside serving as a hub that allows users to purchase goods and keep up to date with the band's activities.

User Stories
------------
- As a new fan of the band, I want to read up on the history of the band so that I can learn more about their legacy.
- As an existing fan of the band, I want to stay up to date with the band's latest activities.
- As someone who has never listened to this band before, I want to book tickets to attend one of their live shows to experience their music.
